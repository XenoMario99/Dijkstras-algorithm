# Dijkstras-algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between one node from a weighted graph called source and the others.

**Input data**: Consistent directed weighted graph represented as 2D array W, which rows and columns are indexed from 0 do n-1, 
where n is a number of vertices comprised in the graph, and element W[i][j] is the weight of the edge between the vertices i and j.  <br />
**Output data**: The set of edges F containing the shortest ways from source to all other vertices. The source is v1 by default.
